I started my professional journey in the field of Psychology before saying
"screw this, let's do something **fun**!". Shortly after I began teaching myself
to code - starting out with HTML/CSS JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. A little later
I enrolled at [Dev Bootcamp](https://devbootcamp.com/).

Since then I've been working professionally as a software developer and loving
every second of it.

If you'd like to reach out to me, the internet has been kind enough to provide
me with several means of contact. Check them out [here!](/contact/)
