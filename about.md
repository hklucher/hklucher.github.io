I'm a software developer by day, and whatever a software developer
at night is by night. While working a research job, I found an interest in
coding, and began teaching myself HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. I soon realized
that learning to code was a heavy task, and one that I would prefer to do in the company of
others, which prompted me to enroll in [Dev Bootcamp's](https://devbootcamp.com/) Chicago
campus. I've been working professionally as software developer ever since, and I've been loving it.

Outside of coding, I'm two-bit musician who can usually be found with headphones on.
I like weird music, sci-fi, bad horror movies, and psychology. If you'd like to reach out,
